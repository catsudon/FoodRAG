# NutriChatBot

Welcome to the NutriChatBot repository! This ChatBot is designed to provide users with reliable nutritional information from a unique dual-perspective approach—both as a patient and a doctor. Our ChatBot utilizes advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to fetch factual data from external sources, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information.

## Features

- **Dual Perspective Interaction:** Engage with the ChatBot either as a patient seeking nutritional advice or a healthcare professional looking for detailed nutritional data.

## How It Works

The NutriChatBot uses a combination of natural language processing and retrieval techniques to provide information that is both precise and relevant. Here’s how it interacts with users:

1. **User Query:** You start by asking a question related to nutrition.
2. **Data Retrieval:** The ChatBot then retrieves information from its extensive database of nutritional data.
3. **Response Generation:** Using the RAG system, the ChatBot formulates a response that not only answers your question but also provides additional context where necessary.
