      "\n",
      "These dishes are safe bets when watching your diet. Plus, you can easily find them at your nearest hawker centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's easy to pack healthy meals and find clean-eating food joints for lunch. But when work piles up at your desk, your healthy diet plans are out the window. Boom. You've got 20 minutes for lunch, and the closest places to you are the hawker centres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dang, you think. All they've got are fat-laden options like char kway teow or rojak. But take heart - not all local fare is full of sodium and calories. These yummy, affordable dishes are great for anyone trying to eat healthier.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For lovers of spicy and savoury flavours, mee soto is a simple dish that packs a punch with noodles made of flour, salt and egg. Ask for extra bean sprouts for a good dose of veggies, and don't finish the soup as that's where the sodium content is highest.\n",
